= How I installed Go on my corporate Windows laptop without administtrator rights

I have started by going to https://golang.org/ ;-)

There, I discovered the link:https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1[_A Tour of Go_] which allows you to start learning the Go language without installing *anything*. Brilliant!

pass:q[<u>*_Remark:_*</u>] The _A Tour of Go_ is built on top of link:https://play.golang.org/[Go Playground, a web service that runs on golang.org's servers. The service receives a Go program, compiles, links, and runs the program inside a sandbox, then returns the output.
